## About
This is a simple C# application built using Windows Forms to calculate salary and tax based on regulations in Iran. The project includes a login page for user authentication and a main dashboard where the salary and tax calculations are performed. It is a personal training and practice project designed to enhance my programming skills while creating a functional and user-friendly tool.

## Introduction
This project is a desktop application developed as part of my personal training in C# and Windows Forms. It aims to assist users in Iran with calculating their net salary after tax deductions. The application features a basic login system for secure access and a dashboard to input salary details and view results. As a practice project, it serves both as a learning exercise for me and a practical tool for estimating take-home pay based on local tax rules.

## What is C#?
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for building a variety of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile apps. Known for its simplicity, strong typing, and extensive libraries, C# is an excellent choice for developing Windows-based applications like this salary and tax calculator.

## What is Windows Forms?
Windows Forms (WinForms) is a graphical user interface (GUI) framework provided by Microsoft as part of the .NET ecosystem. It allows developers to create desktop applications with rich, interactive interfaces using pre-built controls like buttons, text boxes, and labels. This project leverages Windows Forms to provide a straightforward and intuitive experience for users.

## What is Salary and Tax Calculation and Why It Is Important?
Salary and tax calculation involves determining an individual's net income after deducting applicable taxes based on local lawsâ€”in this case, Iran's tax regulations. This process is crucial for:
- **Financial Planning**: Helps individuals understand their take-home pay and manage expenses.
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to tax obligations as per government rules.
- **Transparency**: Provides clarity on how much of the salary goes to taxes and what remains.

This tool simplifies these calculations, making it accessible to users without requiring manual computation or deep knowledge of tax laws.
